# Homework instructions: 
Use the ggplot2 package to plot the Iris data showing length vs width facetting petal/sepal vs flower type, basically reproducing slide 27 of the lecture notes. Feel free to customize the styling as you see fit (color, font size, etc). (Source: raphg/Biostat-578/HW1.md)

# Load data and packages
First we need to load the data and other necessary packages:

```{r}
# load dataset
data(iris)
# load ggplot2 package for graphics
library(ggplot2)
# load reshape2 package for data reshaping
library(reshape2)
```
